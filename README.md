#P1 Day 12
# Recap of Techniques Learned

This README provides a summary of the key techniques and concepts learned and applied throughout the exercises in this project.

## 1. **Variables & Data Types (JavaScript)**
   - Used to store and manipulate data.
   - Common data types include `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, and `object`.
   - Examples: `let`, `const`, `var` for declaring variables with block or function scope.

## 2. **Functions (JavaScript)**
   - Encapsulate logic and can be called multiple times.
   - Used to perform tasks or return values based on inputs.
   - Functions make the code reusable and modular.
   - Example: `function myFunction() { // logic }`.

## 3. **Conditional Statements (JavaScript)**
   - Used to perform actions based on conditions.
   - Common structures include `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch`.
   - Allows for decision-making in the code based on user interaction or data.
   - Example: `if (condition) { // execute } else { // execute something else }`.

## 4. **Loops (JavaScript)**
   - Used to iterate over arrays or run repetitive tasks.
   - Common types: `for`, `while`, and `forEach`.
   - Example: `for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // logic }`.

## 5. **Event Listeners (JavaScript)**
   - Enable interaction with user inputs, mouse clicks, and other actions.
   - Example: `element.addEventListener('click', function)`.
   - Used to trigger functions when a specific event occurs.

## 6. **DOM Manipulation (JavaScript)**
   - Used to dynamically interact with and modify HTML elements.
   - Techniques like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `innerHTML`, and `style` are applied to update the content and style of elements based on logic.
   - Example: `document.getElementById('element').style.backgroundColor = 'blue';`.

## 7. **Basic CSS Styling**
   - Used for layout and visual appearance of HTML elements.
   - Selectors target elements, and properties like `color`, `margin`, `padding`, `font-size`, and `display` adjust appearance.
   - Example: `body { background-color: #f0f0f0; }`.

## 8. **Positioning and Layout (CSS)**
   - Controls the placement of elements on the web page.
   - Properties such as `position`, `display`, `flex`, `grid`, and `float` help design responsive layouts.
   - Example: `position: relative; display: flex;`.

## 9. **Responsive Design (CSS)**
   - Media queries and flexible layouts ensure that websites adapt to different screen sizes.
   - Example: `@media (max-width: 600px) { // styles for small screens }`.

## 10. **Comments & Code Documentation**
   - Comments explain what the code does and help in maintaining and understanding the logic.
   - In JavaScript, `//` or `/* */` is used, while in CSS, `/* */` is used.
   - Comments should be concise, explain core functionality, and avoid cluttering.
